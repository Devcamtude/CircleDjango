# CircleDjango
This project utilized Django's class-based views on the server to implement the user authentication API, 
including login, logout, and sign-up functionalities. It also allowed users to post comments, edit their comments, 
and delete them. Users were able to create groups, join existing groups, and leave them. 
The project displayed the timestamp of each user's post accurately. 
Furthermore, the front end was developed using Bootstrap, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
